description: |
    The Bus Clock Manager (BCM) is a dedicated hardware accelerator
    that manages shared system resources by aggregating requests
    from multiple Resource State Coordinators (RSC). Interconnect
    providers are able to vote for aggregated thresholds values from
    consumers by communicating through their respective RSCs.
